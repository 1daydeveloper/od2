In today’s digital world, having a perfect passport photo is essential for travel, job applications, and official documents. The **OD2 Passport Size Printable Photo Maker (6x4)** is a free, user-friendly online tool that helps you create, crop, and print passport size photos for India, UK, USA, and Australia—right from your browser.

## Why Use an Online Passport Photo Maker?

Traditional photo studios can be expensive and time-consuming. With OD2’s tool, you can:
- Instantly upload and crop your photo to official specifications
- Select your country for automatic sizing (India, UK, USA, Australia)
- Choose DPI (96 or 300) for high-quality prints
- Generate a printable 6x4 sheet with cut lines for easy home or studio printing
- Download single or multiple photos in seconds
- Enjoy privacy—your images are never stored on our servers

## Step-by-Step: How to Use the OD2 Passport Photo Maker

1. **Select Your Country**: Choose from India, UK, USA, or Australia. The tool automatically sets the correct size and aspect ratio.
2. **Upload Your Photo**: Drag and drop or click to upload a JPG or PNG (max 5MB).
3. **Set DPI**: Pick 96 or 300 DPI for your print quality.
4. **Crop Your Photo**: Use the cropping tool to fit your face perfectly within the required dimensions.
5. **Generate & Download**: Preview your cropped photo, then generate a printable 6x4 sheet with cut lines. Download your single photo or the full sheet instantly.

## Official Passport Photo Sizes Supported

## Tips for a Perfect Passport Photo

- Use a plain, light-colored background
- Face the camera directly with a neutral expression
- Ensure even lighting with no harsh shadows
- Remove glasses, hats, and head coverings (unless for religious reasons)
- Make sure your face is clearly visible and not obscured

## Why OD2’s Tool Stands Out

- **Instant cropping, preview, and download**
- **Printable 6x4 sheet with cut lines**
- **Secure and private**—your photos are never stored
