In a digital world where QR codes are the gateway to information, having a tool that allows you to create distinctive, high-quality, and branded codes is essential. We are thrilled to announce the launch of our **Advanced QR Code Generator**, a professional-grade tool available completely for free on [One Day Developers (OD2)](https://www.od2.in).

Unlike many unwanted "free" tools that watermark your images, limit your scans, or force you to create an account, our philosophy is different. We believe essential utilities should be powerful, accessible, and respectful of your privacy.

## Why Use OD2's QR Generator?

### 1. 100% Client-Side Privacy
Most online QR generators send your data to their servers to generate the image. This raises privacy concerns, especially for sensitive Wi-Fi passwords or personal contact info.
**Our tool runs 100% in your browser.** Your data never leaves your device. Whether you're typing a URL, a phone number, or Wi-Fi credentials, it stays with you.

### 2. Professional Customization (Color Studio)
Standard black-and-white QR codes are boring and easily overlooked. Our **Color Studio** allows you to:
*   **Brand It**: Upload your company logo to center it automatically.
*   **Gradients**: Use stunning linear gradients to match your brand colors.
*   **Shapes**: Change the pattern dots (squares, rounded, classy) and corner markers (eyes) independently.
*   **Trend Presets**: One-click application of beautiful, pre-designed color palettes like "Midnight", "Lush", and "Fire".

### 3. Upscale to 4K Ultra HD
Blurry QR codes fail to scan. For print materials like posters, flyers, or business cards, you need high resolution.
We offer **4K Ultra HD export** support. You can download your creation as a crisp PNG, JPG, or efficiently scalable WebP file, ensuring it looks sharp at any size.

### 4. Transparent Backgrounds
Need to place a QR code on a colored brochure or a dark website footer?
Our advanced download settings allow you to export with a **transparent background**, allowing the code to blend seamlessly into your design.

### 5. Supports All Major Data Types
We cover every extensive use case:
*   **URL**: Link to your website or portfolio.
*   **Wi-Fi**: Share your guest network securely.
*   **vCard**: Share contact details instantly.
*   **WhatsApp**: Start a chat with a pre-filled message.
*   **Email, Text, Phone**: Direct communication triggers.
*   **Location**: Share precise GPS coordinates.

## How to Create Your Custom QR Code

1.  **Select Type**: Choose what you want to share (Website, Text, Wi-Fi, etc.).
2.  **Enter Data**: Input the link or content.
3.  **Customize**: Use the "Color Studio" to add your brand colors and change the dot styles.
4.  **Add Logo**: Upload your logo for a professional touch.
5.  **Download**: Choose "Ultra HD" and hit download!
