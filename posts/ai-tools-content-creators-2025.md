faqs:
  - question: "Are these AI tools free to use?"
    answer: "Most offer freemium models. Basic features are often free (like ChatGPT's free tier or Canva), while premium limits and advanced features require a subscription."
  - question: "Can AI tools replace human creativity entirely?"
    answer: "No. They are productivity amplifiers, not replacements. Human insight, strategy, and emotional connection are still essential for high-quality content."
  - question: "How do I choose the right AI tool?"
    answer: "Identify your bottleneck (writing, video, audio). Test 2-3 top tools in that category using free trials, and choose the one that fits your workflow."
  - question: "Will using AI tools affect my content's originality?"
    answer: "Not if used correctly. Use AI for drafts, outlines, or editing, then add your unique voice and perspective. Purely AI-generated content can feel generic."
  - question: "What about data privacy with AI tools?"
    answer: "Always check privacy policies. Be careful not to input sensitive personal or proprietary data into public AI models, as they may use it for training."
