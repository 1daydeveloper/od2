## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q1: How long does it take to get AdSense approval?

A: The AdSense review process typically takes 24-48 hours, but can sometimes take up to 14 days depending on your website's complexity and Google's review queue. During peak times or for complex sites, reviews might take longer. If you haven't heard back within 14 days, you can check your application status in your AdSense account.

### Q2: Can I apply for AdSense with a new website?

A: While there's no strict age requirement for websites, it's recommended to wait until your site has at least 20-30 high-quality pages and consistent traffic. New websites should focus on building valuable content, establishing user engagement, and ensuring technical compliance before applying for AdSense.

### Q3: What should I do if my AdSense application is rejected?

A: If rejected, carefully review Google's feedback email for specific reasons. Common issues include insufficient content, policy violations, or technical problems. Address all mentioned issues, continue creating quality content, improve user experience, and wait at least 30 days before reapplying to ensure all improvements are properly implemented.

### Q4: Does my website need a certain amount of traffic for AdSense approval?

A: Google doesn't specify minimum traffic requirements, but your site should have genuine organic traffic from search engines and direct visits. Focus on creating content that attracts real users rather than trying to artificially inflate traffic numbers, as Google can detect fake traffic patterns.

### Q5: Are there any content topics that AdSense won't approve?

A: Yes, AdSense has strict content policies. Prohibited content includes adult material, violence, illegal activities, copyrighted content, misleading information, and content that promotes hatred or discrimination. Review Google's Publisher Policies thoroughly and ensure your content aligns with family-safe guidelines.

### Q6: Do I need SSL certificate and privacy policy for AdSense approval?

A: Yes, both are essential requirements. Your website must have an SSL certificate (HTTPS) for security, and you must have a comprehensive privacy policy that explains how you collect, use, and protect user data. These pages should be easily accessible from your website's footer or main navigation.
